Write a SimpleCalculator class that has public methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing two
doubles. SimpleCalculator has a private data member called answer. After performing
an operation, assign the result to answer. And a member function named getAnswer that will retrieve the result of
the last arithmetic operation performed by the object. Also, add a constructor for class SimpleCalculator
that initializes the value of answer to 0.

Note: You may expect the divisor of the divide function will not equal 0.
