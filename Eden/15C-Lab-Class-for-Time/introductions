Please read the source code below carefully and finish the class Time's declaration and implementation.

The class Time has three member variables(type: integer): hour, minute, second.

And it has many member functions:

1. constructors (it's tricky!)

2. destructor (it needs to print some info like "Recycle time: HH:MM:SS AM/PM")

3. setter and getter for three member variables above.

4. toString, which returns the formatted time like "HH:MM:SS AM/PM"

5. isVaild, which judges whether the time is valid (range: 0:0:0-23:59:59)

6. after, which returns the time after some seconds from current time.

Attention: Read the source code in main.cpp for more details.
hour >= 12 即输出PM。

toString中，输出的HH，为hour%12的结果。

对于minute和second则不进行处理，直接输出
