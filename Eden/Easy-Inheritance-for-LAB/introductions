This is the easiest problem I have met!

 

There are 5 classes A, B, C, D, and E.

Each class has the following form (X stands for the name of the class):


 
Find out the appropriate inheritance relationship between class A, B, C, D, and E.
 
With the following main function, we can get the sample output.
 
Your submitted source code should include the whole implementation of the 5 classes.
 
 
Submit the ABCDE.cpp
 
 
Sample input:
#include <iostream>
#include "ABCDE.cpp"
using namespace std;

int main() {
  B b;
  return 0;
}
 
Sample output:
In E()
In C()
In D()
In C()
In A()
In B()
In ~B()
In ~A()
In ~C()
In ~D()
In ~C()
In ~E()
