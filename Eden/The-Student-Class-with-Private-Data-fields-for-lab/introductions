The class "Student" is declared as below.

Student {

 public:

  Student();

  Student(int, const char*, int);

  void set(int, const char*, int);

  void print();

 private:

  int id;

  char name[50];

  int age;

};

Please implement the class to get expected output. You don't need to submit the main function.

If the following main function is used, your implementation should get the expected output in the sample.

int main() {

  Student std1, std2(123, "John Smith", 19), std3(124);

  std1.set(100, "Bill Gates", 55);

  std1.print();

  std2.print();

  std3.print();

  return 0;

}

 

Sample Output:
Bill Gates (100) is 55 years old.
John Smith (123) is 19 years old.
No Name (124) is 0 years old.
