Description
Suppose that the tuition for Zhongshan Universtiy is 10000 this year and tuition increases 5% every year. Write a program that reads an integer n(n>0) and uses a loop to compute the cost of the tuition's worth of the nth year.

If the answer is not a integer, cut off the digits.(e.g. 17.88 -> 17)

If the given n is more than 100, n = n % 100.

 

Input
An integer n (n>0).

Output
The total cost of four years worth of tuition starting n years from now. 

You should set the precision to 2 and fixed.

Sample Input
10
Sample Output
